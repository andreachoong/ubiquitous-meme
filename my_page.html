I always listen to KPOP music whenever I do my assignments or during my free time. From them, I started to have several favourite artists in the KPOP industry. I follow them on social media to know more about them and how is their life as a KPOP singer. <b>And don't forget to stream BTS new music video!</b></p>

	<h1 id="country">My Favourite Country</h1>

	<p>I always love travelling to different countries. It can be either within the country, Malaysia or outside of the country like overseas. I used to travel everytime but now I travel about once or twice a year. The cost of travelling is very expensive nowadays and my family and I cannot afford it. We save up as much as we want and look for promotions on hotels or travel tours in several websites.I always dream to travel when I start working and travel around the world while working. I planned to travel to five different countries of my choice.</p>
	<p><br>Here is a list of my favourite countries </br></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Korea</li>
		<li>Australia</li>
		<li>Dubai</li>
		<li>New Zealand</li>
		<li>America</li>
		<li>Japan</li>
	</ul>
